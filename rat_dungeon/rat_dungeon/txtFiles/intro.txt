***ZERO RAT KINGDOM DUNGEON***

Welcome to Zero Rat Kingdom Dungeon: a short game about exploring 6 floors of a rat-themed dungeon.
Each floor has 6 rooms to explore before moving on to the next one.
In each room, you have a large chance of facing an enemy and getting some useful loot.
At the end, you will face a powerful boss. Good luck in your journey!

***COMBAT***
Fighting an enemy consists of both you and your opponent taking turns to attack each other.
When an attack is made, the game will roll a virtual d20 (20-sided die) and add the "attack" value.
Then it will compare it to the opponents AC(armor class).
If the roll + attack is equal to or higher than the opponents AC, the attack lands. Otherwise, it misses.

+Example+

Enemy AC: 14
Your attack: +2

You attack: game rolls a d20 and adds your attack to the result. If the result is higher/equal to 14, the attack lands.

In other words, the higher a character's AC (Armor Class), the harder it is to hit them.
Also, the higher a character's attack, the more likely they are to hit the target.


After an attack lands, damage is calculated. The higher your attack the more damage it can potentially deal.

+Example+

Enemy HP(health points): 20

You attack the enemy!
The attack hit!
You deal 5 damage to the enemy

Enemy HP: 15


If your HP drops to 0, the game is over.

***ITEMS***
As you explore rooms and fight enemies, you will get a chance to collect items that make you stronger.
On each floor you will get a chance of finding a weapon, a shield and armor. Each new floor has stronger items.
You will also get a chance to find healing potions to restore health during combat.
Each different item icreases a different stat:

Weapons increase attack.
Armor increases HP.
Shields increase AC

+Example+

Your AC is 13
You found a +1 Shield!
Your AC is 14

If you find a new item, it will replace the corresponding item you already had.

+Example+
Your armor: +1 shirt
You found a +2 shirt
Your armor: +2 shirt
